2. **Palette Reordering** (Feature updated and completed as of April 2024)
   - Implement a functional button to reorder colors in the palette based on ascending hexcode values. This upcoming feature will simplify navigation and help users quickly locate specific colors within the palette. It enhances usability and aesthetics by organizing colors in a more structured and visually appealing manner.
3. **Display Brand Name on Color Hover**
   - Improve the user experience by displaying the brand name of each color when the mouse hovers over it in the palette. Knowing the brand name will enable users to easily locate and purchase the specific yarn needed to bring their project designs to life.
